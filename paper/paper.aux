This interaction triggers the release of NICD (Notch Intracellular Domain) in cell $A$, which \emph  {promotes} Notch, \emph  {inhibits} Delta, and \emph  {promotes} Jagged.

This phenomenon, known as \emph  {cis-inhibition}, cleaves the Notch receptor but does not release NICD. }}{2}{figure.1}\protected@file@percent }

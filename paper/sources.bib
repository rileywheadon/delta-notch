	shorttitle = {Pattern Formation by Lateral Inhibition with Feedback},
	abstract = {In many developing tissues, adjacent cells diverge in character so as to create a fine-grained pattern of cells in contrasting states of differentiation. It has been proposed that such patterns can be generated through lateral inhibition—a type cells–cell interaction whereby a cell that adopts a particular fate inhibits its immediate neighbours from doing likewise. Lateral inhibition is well documented in flies, worms and vertebrates. In all of these organisms, the transmembrane proteins Notch and Delta (or their homologues) have been identified as mediators of the interaction—Notch as receptor, Delta as its ligand on adjacent cells. However, it is not clear under precisely what conditions the Delta-Notch mechanism of lateral inhibition can generate the observed types of pattern, or indeed whether this mechanism is capable of generating such patterns by itself. Here we construct and analyse a simple and general mathematical model of such contact-mediated lateral inhibition. In accordance with experimental data, the model postulates that receipt of inhibition (i.e. activation of Notch) diminishes the ability to deliver inhibition (i.e. to produce active Delta). This gives rise to a feedback loop that can amplify differences between adjacent cells. We investigate the pattern-forming potential and temporal behavior of this model both analytically and through numerical simulation. Inhomogeneities are self-amplifying and develop without need of any other machinery, provided the feedback is sufficiently strong. For a wide range of initial and boundary conditions, the model generates fine-grained patterns similar to those observed in living systems.},

	abstract = {Notch signaling pathway mediates cell-fate determination during embryonic development, wound healing, and tumorigenesis. This pathway is activated when the ligand Delta or the ligand Jagged of one cell interacts with the Notch receptor of its neighboring cell, releasing the Notch Intracellular Domain ({NICD}) that activates many downstream target genes. {NICD} affects ligand production asymmetrically––it represses Delta, but activates Jagged. Although the dynamical role of Notch–Jagged signaling remains elusive, it is widely recognized that Notch–Delta signaling behaves as an intercellular toggle switch, giving rise to two distinct fates that neighboring cells adopt––Sender (high ligand, low receptor) and Receiver (low ligand, high receptor). Here, we devise a specific theoretical framework that incorporates both Delta and Jagged in Notch signaling circuit to explore the functional role of Jagged in cell-fate determination. We find that the asymmetric effect of {NICD} renders the circuit to behave as a three-way switch, giving rise to an additional state––a hybrid Sender/Receiver (medium ligand, medium receptor). This phenotype allows neighboring cells to both send and receive signals, thereby attaining similar fates. We also show that due to the asymmetric effect of the glycosyltransferase Fringe, different outcomes are generated depending on which ligand is dominant: Delta-mediated signaling drives neighboring cells to have an opposite fate; Jagged-mediated signaling drives the cell to maintain a similar fate to that of its neighbor. We elucidate the role of Jagged in cell-fate determination and discuss its possible implications in understanding tumor–stroma cross-talk, which frequently entails Notch–Jagged communication.},

	shorttitle = {Notch signalling},
	abstract = {Notch is the receptor in a highly conserved signalling pathway that is crucial in development and implicated in malignant transformation. The basic paradigm of Notch signalling is simple, and involves proteolytic cleavage to release an intracellular fragment (Nicd) that functions to regulate transcription.In the nucleus, Nicd displaces a repression complex and, with the {DNA}-binding {CSL} ({CBF}1, Su(H) and {LAG}-1) protein, recruits the co-activator Mastermind. Additional epigenetic cofactors are implicated and recruitment of kinases and ubiquitin ligases probably contribute to rapid turnover of the activator complex.Activity of the receptor is also regulated post-translationally. A number of different auxiliary components are implicated, including several ubiquitin ligases and proteins, such as Numb, that have direct links to the endocytic machinery.Notch ligands are transmembrane proteins and they require E3 ubiquitin ligases for their activity. The mechanisms whereby the ligands become competent to signal are not yet known, but probably entail endocytosis. Localization and cleavage of ligands might also contribute to their regulation.In many developmental processes, feedback mechanisms operate to amplify or restrict the activity of the Notch pathway. These include transcriptional regulation of auxiliary factors that in turn influence ligand or receptor activity and {microRNAs}.},

	abstract = {Understanding pattern formation driven by cell–cell interactions has been a significant theme in cellular biology for many years. In particular, due to their implications within many biological contexts, lateral-inhibition mechanisms present in the Notch-Delta signalling pathway led to an extensive discussion between biologists and mathematicians. Deterministic and stochastic models have been developed as a consequence of this discussion, some of which address long-range signalling by considering cell protrusions reaching non-neighbouring cells. The dynamics of such signalling systems reveal intricate properties of the coupling terms involved in these models. In this work, we investigate the advantages and drawbacks of a single-parameter long-range signalling model across diverse scenarios. By employing linear and multi-scale analyses, we discover that pattern selection is not only partially explained but also depends on nonlinear effects that extend beyond the scope of these analytical techniques.},

Final project for MATH 462 2024W2 with Dr. Eric Cytrynbaum.

By Riley Wheadon, Ziyi Zhuang, and Edwin Huras.

## Creating a Virtual Environment

To run the Gillespie model, you will need to create a Python virtual environment:

1. Open a terminal and run the command `python -m venv .venv`
2. Then, activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Finally, install the necessary packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you need to add dependencies to the project, install them in the virtual environment using the command `pip install [PACKAGE]`. Then, from the root directory of the project, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This saves your dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file and makes it easier for everyone else to run your code.
